# IP_PBX_VoIP_Gateway_Prototype
This project is intended to serve as a high level design methodology, pursuant to request for services issued for the design
evaluation of a IP-PBX based VoIP Gateway. Based on the design and performance requirements desired by the client, evaluation 
tests were carried out using the Beagle Bone Black platform, with the aid of external hardware and software components. Using
these test results, which are listed as project deliverables, the suitability of the AM 3358 MPU for the IP-PBX based VoIP
Gateway was evaluated, along with providing recommendations pertaining to full system design and performance.

Pursuant to the Request for Services (RFS), Alvakonda,
Tichkule, and Yamasani have evaluated the suitability of the AM3358 MPU for the
design of a e911 IP-PBX VoIP Gateway product. Critical aspects such as operating
system compatibility, computational power, I/O interfacing, development cost,
adaptability and reliability were evaluated.

Hardware interface capabilities were evaluated using network interfaces (USB and
Ethernet), serial ports, HDMI displays, as well as multimedia storage devices. The
AM3358 also displayed ease of operation with various distributions of Windows
(WINCE 2007 and WINCE 2013) and Linux (Debian, Angstrom, Asterisk) operating
systems. Software development, OS customization and building, was easily facilitated by
the use of standard toolchains like GNU-ARM and Microsoft Visual Studio 2008. Based
on the evaluation and test results, we can affirm that the AM3358 MPU is capable of
handling the interfacing and processing requirements for the e911 IP-PBX VoIP
Gateway product.

Telephony and PBX functionality was implemented using a off-the-shelf softphone
software (Zoiper), and the Asterisk OS. Specifically, the ability to make inter-softphone
calls with SIP functionality, routed via the PBX hosted on the AM3358 MPU based
Beagle Bone Black platform, was successfully tested and verified. The AM3358 MPU
was also able to successfully process audio and speech signals (with a VAX DMIPS of
646) by executing standard decoding algorithms like G.711.

Based on the relative ease of system integration, we forecast that the product will be
ready to market within the next 18 months. Also, our cost considerations indicate that
the total price for bulk development of the product is well within the budget
specifications provided by Patton Equipment. Based on these factors, our evaluation
team strongly recommends the AM3358 MPU for the VoIP Gateway product.
